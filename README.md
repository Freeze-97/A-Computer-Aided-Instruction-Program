# --A-Computer-Aided-Instruction-Program
A simple CAI program for primary school students (sothe numbers involved in the program are in the range 0…100) for the so it contains at least the following features:
1) The user could choose to do practices, test or quit the program (main menu).
2) For a practice -
The user should be able to choose doing the practices on additions only, subtractions
only, or mixed additions with subtractions. The number of questions in a practice is
fixed to be 10. For each question, the user is asked to give the answer. If the answer
is not correct, the program should continue ask the user to give an answer, until a
correct one is given. When the practice is completed, it should be back to the main
menu to allow the user to choose practice, test or quit.
3) For a test -
The user should be able to choose to do a test on additions only, subtractions only,
or mixed additions with subtractions. The number of questions in the test is fixed to
be 15. When the test is completed, it should show the test result (in percentage). It
should be back to the main menu to allow the user to choose practice, test or quit.
5) Responses to the answers
6) Show the results of a test
7) Requirement on questions -
   Suppose that the user does not have the knowledge of negative numbers and
   could only know the arithmetic with 2 decimal digits ( 0..100). So a valid
   question should give an answer in the range 0..100: any answer less than 0 or
   great than or equal to 100 is not valid.
   So, when you generate a random subtraction question, you should make sure the result is not negative.
